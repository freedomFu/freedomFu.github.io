Hello there🫡! Wish you have a nice day 😁

My name is Yanduo Fu (付彦铎 in Chinese). I am currently an Eng.D candidate at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Ding Wang](http://wangdingg.weebly.com/). Prior to this, I earned a joint Master of Engineering degree with the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/)), and the Institute of Information Engineering ([IIE](https://www.iie.ac.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Senior Engineer Qiongxiao Wang](https://dblp.org/pid/52/8379.html) in the research team led by [Professor Jingqiang Lin](https://lin-jingqiang.github.io/). During this period, I also participated in an academic seminar led by [Associate Professor Bingyu Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bingyu-Li-12). Additionally, I have been interning with [Associate Professor Huawei Mei's Dreamtech group](https://dreamtech.team/) since my sophomore year at North China Electric Power University ([NCEPU](https://net.ncepu.edu.cn/)) in Baoding.

<p style="font-size: 9pt;">我的本意是做一个学术个人主页，随着时间的推移觉得越来越菜，能留下的记忆越来越偏向于个人的爱好，不如就作为个人博客网站放着得了。</p>

🎯 My research fields mainly include password-based authentication, password manager, end-to-end testing. Additionally, I'm currently intrigued by the fields of network measurement and digital forensics. I aspire to leverage technical skills to safeguard the security of the internet and the privacy of users.

✨ In life, I prefer to engage in some gentle exercises, such as health-preserving basketball, yoga, strength training, jogging, reading, and listening to the same piece of music repeatedly. I also occasionally play single-player games (e.g., NBA 2K series).

🧗 **Motto:** Do it anyway.
